license:LPS OPEN DATA
Land & Property Services (LPS) has made a number of Ordnance Survey of
Northern Ireland® (OSNI®) branded datasets available free of charge under the
terms of the current Open Government Licence (OGL). These datasets – which
include raster and vector mapping, boundary, gazetteer, height, street and townland
products – are available for download. Each dataset is clearly marked with the OGL
symbol shown below
The OGL allows you to:
• copy, distribute and transmit the data;
• adapt the data; and
• exploit the data commercially, whether by sub-licensing it, combining it with
other data, or including it in your own product or application.
You are therefore able to use the LPS datasets in any way and for any purpose. We
simply ask that you acknowledge the copyright and the source of the data by
including the following attribution statement:
Contains LPS Intellectual Property © Crown copyright and database right (year)
This information is licensed under the terms of the Open Government Licence
(http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3).
You must also:
• include the same acknowledgement requirement in any sub-licences of the
data that you grant, and a requirement that any further sub-licences do the
same;
• ensure that you do not use the data in a way that suggests LPS endorses you
or your use of the data; and
• make sure you do not misrepresent the data or its source.
N.B. Any dataset that does not expressly state that it has been released under OGL will
require a licence from LPS and the appropriate licence fee will be applied.
